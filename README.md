# PyBer Analysis

## **Overview of the analysis**

The first task was explore  PyBer rideshare data from January to May 2019. The first round gave information regarding fares, rides and drivers categorizing by city type as measures of Central tendency, bubble charts of rides vs. drivers, box-and-whisker plots to check outliers and pie charts.

Now it is requested a new analysis to know more about the rides. It was requested a ride summary and a multiple line chart of total fares for each city type.


## **Results**
The data was grouped per city type to check the market participation. It is important to point out that in the previous analysis was concluded that Urban City Type has highest participation regarding rides number, drivers population and competitive fare.

So now with the new summary we can see the following:

1. Urban city type keeps consistently with the highest participation regarding  to rides number, drivers population and fares profit.
2. However the urban average fares per ride and driver are the cheapest, the volume leads its impact.
3. Rural city type is the lowest per rides number and drivers population. But, here you find the must expensive average fares per ride and driver.
4. Suburban city type maintains her middle participation.
5. As last point as you can observe in the following plot the behaviour trend during the first four months of the year are the same and they keep the congruency regarding to have the best profit fare with urban city type, a second priority with suburban city type and it is no surprising to see the rural type in the last position.
