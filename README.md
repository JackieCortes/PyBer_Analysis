# PyBer Analysis

## **Overview of the analysis**

The first task was explore  PyBer rideshare data from January to May 2019. The first round gave information regarding fares, rides and drivers categorizing by city type as measures of Central tendency, bubble charts of rides vs. drivers, box-and-whisker plots to check outliers and pie charts.

Now it is requested a new analysis to know more about the rides. It was requested a ride summary and a multiple line chart of total fares for each city type.


## **Results**
The data were grouped per city type to check the market participation. It is essential to point out that in the previous analysis was concluded that Urban City Type has the first position regarding rides number, drivers population, and competitive fare.
So now, with the new summary, we can see the following:

1. Urban city type consistently has the highest participation regarding rides number, drivers population, and fares profit.
2. However, the urban average fares per ride and driver are the cheapest, and the volume leads its impact.
3. Rural city type is the lowest per rides number and drivers population. But, here, you find the most expensive average fares per ride and driver.
4. The Suburban city type maintains her middle participation.
5. As the last point, as you can observe in the following plot, the behavior trend during the first four months of the year are the same. They keep the congruency regarding having the best profit fare with urban city type, a second priority with suburban city type. It is not surprising to see the rural type in the last position.

## **Summary**

After this analysis it is suggested:

1. It is required a new strategy to support the rural and suburban city type adding more drivers to obtain life quality.
2. The urban-type can support a raise in the fare rides based on the fares of the other city types.
3. Taking a condition to increase the drivers' population in point one, it would consider planning to raise the rides.
